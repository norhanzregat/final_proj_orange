                In this project, we started by designing the models using Fusion 360, where the models were created with
                great precision to suit the requirements. After completing the digital designs, we moved to the
                practical implementation stage using 3D printers such as Ender 2. These printers enabled us to transform
                the digital models into real models through the 3D printing process. In addition, we used auxiliary
                tools such as Beam Studio to adjust the printing settings and control the laser printing details, and
                INKSPACE to edit and format the graphics that were used in the printing stage. All of these tools
                contributed to improving the quality of the final models and making the process more smooth and
                professional.

                I have created a series of models in the lab before, and they caught my attention and admiration for
                their wonderful design and detail. These models were the first thing I saw in the lab, which made me
                excited to start creating many similar projects, one after the other. I will now display these works in
                the documentation.

                This is the first ready design, it was downloaded from a site called Ultimaker Robot and it was printed
                on Cura to see the 3D prototype.

                In this section, the images that I want to put in the design have been taken and cut using the INKSPACE
                program and the image has been extracted using several commands in this software. Then the image has
                been opened in the Beam Studio program and a frame has been made for it and the layers have been
                modified and selected which ones we want to print and cut using Laser Cutting.

                This is my first model that was designed on Fusion 360, then imported into Cura, its dimensions were
                adjusted precisely and tightly, and then the print command was given to be printed on the Ender2 3D
                printer.
