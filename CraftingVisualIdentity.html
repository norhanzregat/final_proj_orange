        Engineer Iyad Al-Ghanaymeh gave us a comprehensive session on photography, in which he addressed several
        important topics that enhance photography skills, whether using professional cameras or smartphones. Engineer
        Iyad began by explaining the different types of cameras and the basic differences between them, highlighting the
        advantages of each type and its appropriate uses, which helped us understand how to choose the ideal camera
        based on photography needs. He then moved on to talk about lenses and their various types, and how each type
        affects the quality and details of the image, in addition to explaining the basic laws of photography that
        include concepts such as exposure, lighting, and depth of field, which play a major role in improving the
        aesthetics and professionalism of the image.<br /><br />

        Eng. Iyad also touched on the art of smartphone photography, explaining that phones today are equipped with
        high-quality cameras that allow for capturing stunning images, with a focus on how to exploit their advanced
        features to achieve the best results. In the final section of the lecture, he introduced us to the Lightroom
        application and the basics of editing it, explaining how to use this application professionally to adjust
        colors, lighting, and image details, adding an aesthetic touch and transforming images into works of art. The
        lecture was a valuable opportunity to acquire basic photography skills and learn how to use editing tools to
        improve the quality of images and make them closer to professionalism.

        We had an insightful session with engineer Ahmad Saeedin, where he walked us through the essential steps of
        designing logos, brochures, and pamphlets to build a cohesive brand identity. He emphasized the importance of

        demonstrated how Photoshop offers powerful features for professional-grade design and advanced editing, ideal
        for creating detailed and intricate branding elements. Meanwhile, he explained how Canva is a simpler,
        user-friendly tool that’s perfect for beginners or quick designs without sacrificing quality. With these tools,

        We had an enlightening session on video editing using CapCut and the art of shooting professional-quality videos
        with a smartphone. The session covered the importance of understanding the fundamentals of videography, such as
        framing, lighting, and sound, to capture visually appealing and engaging footage. We learned various techniques
        for stabilizing shots, setting up effective lighting, and optimizing audio quality to achieve professional
        standards in our videos. By utilizing CapCut’s advanced features, we were shown how to enhance raw footage with
        transitions, effects, and color grading, significantly elevating the overall production quality of our work.<br /><br />

        In addition, the session explored the seamless integration of different video elements to create cohesive and
        compelling narratives. Practical insights were shared on effectively storyboarding ideas, organizing clips, and
        synchronizing audio tracks to maintain a smooth flow throughout the video. We also learned to use CapCut’s
        intuitive interface to merge video segments, add text overlays, and incorporate background music, ensuring all
        components harmonize. This comprehensive training provided valuable skills in both the technical and creative
        aspects of video production, empowering us to produce high-quality videos that effectively communicate our

        After deciding on the project name, we started moving on to designing our logo. At this stage, we tried out
        several different designs, using some AI-powered tools to generate new ideas and innovative shapes, in addition
        to designs we prepared ourselves, where we tried to combine our personal vision with the visual elements that
        accurately represent the project. We divided the design process into several stages, first we started by
        generating some initial ideas using AI, which helped us get a variety of shapes and colors that are in line with
        the project’s goals. Then we modified some of these designs manually, taking into account the fine details that
        reflect the project’s values ​​and spirit. After that, we started evaluating the different designs in terms of
        consistency, simplicity, and visual strength, and we worked on modifying the small details in each design to
        meet our needs more accurately.<br />

        These are some examples of the designs that were worked on, which show the development of ideas and the
        modifications that were made at each stage until we reached the point where we could settle on a final design.

        Several designs for the project logo were designed using Canva, where we tried out many different ideas that
        were in line with the project vision. However, none of these designs were finally approved as shown in the
        previous examples. The beginning was to explore a wide range of options, but we faced some challenges in
        choosing the most appropriate design. One of the most important challenges we faced was the color mix, as it was
        difficult to determine the ideal colors that reflect the medical nature of the project. At first, we tried to
        use a variety of colors, but we realized that we should choose colors that match the medical aspect of the
        project and inspire confidence and professionalism. After many discussions, we decided to focus on colors that
        express comfort, cleanliness, and professionalism, such as light blue, green, and white, which are considered
        approved colors in the medical field. Our goal now is to reach a simple and clear design that accurately
        reflects the professionalism of the project while maintaining simplicity and visual appeal. At this stage, we
        are working on establishing the appropriate color and the final design style.

        Here, work began on the final design of the logo, where colors were adopted that match the medical character of
        the project. As you can see in the design, we chose a set of colors that match the concept of the project, and
        they were carefully chosen to express the credibility and professionalism that we want the logo to appear with.
        The colors that were adopted in the design include light blue, which symbolizes trust and calm, and is a common
        color in the medical field, in addition to green, which symbolizes health and growth. White was also used to
        provide a sense of purity and cleanliness, which is essential in everything related to healthcare. These colors
        were chosen based on our knowledge of the importance of using colors that convey a sense of comfort and safety
        in the medical field, in line with the idea of ​​the stethoscope that combines technology and healthcare. The
        design also relies on some aquatic concepts that enhance the sense of cleanliness and purity, as is the case in
        the use of symbols that refer to hearing and medical care. These colors represent an ideal combination that
        highlights the essence of the project and directly links it to the medical sector.
