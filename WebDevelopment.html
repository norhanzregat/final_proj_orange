            The image represents a preliminary design of an HTML website on the topic of “Artificial Intelligence.” The
            website includes several sections such as “About AI,” “Applications,” “The Future of AI,” “Gallery,”
            “Resources,” and “Contact.” The design begins with a header that contains the site title and a sentence
            expressing exploration of the future of technology, in addition to a list of links to navigate between the
            different sections. This is followed by the navigation section that facilitates access to the different
            pages of the website. The design presents the basic structure of the page in a simplified manner without
            going into the fine details of tags or other HTML elements.

                Image represents a basic formatting of a web page using CSS to adjust the appearance of the site.
                Modifications include settings such as removing default margins and borders, adjusting the alignment and
                spacing of elements, as well as customizing the background and colors of text. There is also formatting
                for the header to stand out by changing the font size and colors, and formatting the text within the
                different sections so that it is clear and easy to read on the page.
