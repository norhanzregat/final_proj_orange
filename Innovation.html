                In the first week, we covered the concept of “Spark Innovation”, which focuses on stimulating creative
                ideas and innovation within teams or organizations. This concept aims to find new solutions to
                challenges and improve processes or products by promoting creative thinking, encouraging breaking out of
                traditional patterns, and leveraging diverse teams to bring different perspectives. The basic idea is
                that innovation is not just a new idea, but rather a continuous process of improvement and adaptation to
                variables to achieve better results and make a positive impact.d as the target that will now be studied
                during the three points and prototypes will be made for it.

                In the Entrepreneurship course, we reviewed a set of topics that aim to develop a deep understanding of
                the concept of entrepreneurship and the role of the entrepreneur in society. We started by reviewing the
                previous sessions to reinforce the concepts and confirm their understanding, then we moved on to talk
                about the importance of innovation and how to stimulate it as an essential part of the success of
                entrepreneurial projects. We also learned about the basic qualities and skills that an entrepreneur must
                possess, such as the ability to lead and take risks. We also discussed the challenges that entrepreneurs
                may face and ways to deal with them to ensure continued success. To add a practical aspect, we reviewed
                inspiring success stories, such as the story of Steve Jobs, who challenged traditional standards in the
                field of technology, and the story of Jack Ma, who was able to establish one of the largest companies in
                the world despite his humble beginnings. These topics combined were aimed at providing us with a
                comprehensive understanding of how to achieve success in the world of entrepreneurship.

            a positive and open way, using brainstorming and design thinking through three common questions, which
            are:<br />
            1.How might we? <br />
            2.Year Goal? <br />

            problems from the point of view of the team members as a whole and from all groups. Several sections were
            chosen that we wanted to address, including health, energy, and food. Under each of these names, the most
            important problems that we will be able to solve were identified and voted on.

            We had the opportunity to attend a detailed and important session on Jordanian labor law and company
            formation at ODV-Irbid, led by the experienced NRC lawyers, Mr. Murad and Mr. Anas, along with the skilled

            insight into key regulations that define the rights and responsibilities of both employees and employers.
            Additionally, we explored the different types of companies allowed in Jordan and the legal distinctions
            between each type, focusing on their respective rights and obligations.<br /><br />

            Moreover, the session included a thorough discussion on the process of obtaining work permits for both
            Jordanians and Syrians, covering the requirements and procedures involved. This workshop was an invaluable
            opportunity for acquiring essential legal knowledge that is particularly beneficial for trainees and
            students at the start of their careers, as it helps them grasp the foundational aspects and challenges of

            During one of the special meetings, we attended a session with Engineer Qusay Malahameh, who shared with us
            his inspiring experience in entrepreneurship. Engineer Qusay started his career as an ambitious engineer,
            and thanks to his efforts and experience with a team of engineers, he was able to establish his first
            company, Menalab, which was the beginning of an ambitious idea aimed at developing the electronics and 3D
            tools industry. Initially, the company focused on small and simple projects, but it quickly expanded to
            include a wider range of technical fields. Today, Menalab has become a leading institution that provides
            advanced services in the field of designing and manufacturing 3D tools, developing smart electronics, in
            addition to providing training courses and educational workshops that aim to enable individuals and
            communities to benefit from these technologies to improve their daily lives. One of the company's most
            notable achievements is that it contributes to facilitating access to advanced tools for young developers
            and students, making technology accessible to everyone. The session was an inspiration for us, as we learned
            about the importance of persistence and hard work to turn ideas into a tangible reality that serves the
            world.
