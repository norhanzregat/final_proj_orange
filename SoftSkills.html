                Through Coach Belqis In this topic, we discussed presentation programs, and focused on the features that
                a presenter must have to achieve a successful and effective presentation. The most important of these
                features are: the ability to communicate clearly, self-confidence, and familiarity with the techniques
                of using presentation programs such as Microsoft PowerPoint, Google Slides or Canva. Training sessions
                were organized and presentations were made by participants in divided teams, with the aim of enhancing
                these skills. Through these group presentations, participants were able to explore best practices,
                exchange ideas, and develop their abilities to present content in an attractive and influential way,
                which contributes to improving the quality of presentations and increasing the impact on the audience.

                We were divided into small teams, through which one topic was chosen to make a presentation on it and
                discuss several topics and main titles, including the name of the topic, what is the problem, what is
                the solution to this problem, who are the competitors, the specific age group, and other matters. In
                this presentation, we reviewed the role of artificial intelligence in the labor market and its impact on
                future jobs, with a focus on improving efficiency and automation. We discussed practical examples of
                artificial intelligence applications and how companies and individuals can benefit from them. In
                addition, we suggested solutions to the challenges that workers may face, such as developing technical
                skills, continuous training, and professional rehabilitation to adapt to new transformations. The goal
                is to enable attendees to understand this technology and prepare for the upcoming changes in work
                environments in a positive and constructive manner.

                Coach Balqees gave us this presentation as part of an online lecture on training programs that focus on
                efficiency and self-empowerment. The lecture covered how to develop life skills, such as daily time
                management and prioritization, to enhance our productivity and efficiency in professional and personal
                life. Balqees focused on the importance of organizing daily tasks and adhering to deadlines, which helps
                us achieve our goals more efficiently and relieve stress from work and life pressures. The presentation
                was rich with practical examples and tips that can be applied to improve our quality of life and manage
                our time better.

            With Coach Belqis, we talked about the topic of “Change Management”. The lecture focused on the importance
            of change management in work environments and how to deal with organizational or technological
            transformations effectively. I learned that change management is a structured process that aims to help
            individuals and teams move from a certain situation to a future situation in a smooth and organized manner.
            This process includes several stages such as planning, implementing strategies, effective communication, and
            providing support to employees to help them adapt to changes. The importance of the role of leaders in
            promoting a culture of positive change and building trust during transitional periods was also emphasized.

            The five most popular change management models were discussed, including: Kubler, Kurt Lewin, McKenzie,
            Adkar, and Kotter. These models were briefly reviewed, with emphasis on their importance in implementing
            organizational or personal changes. The lecture aimed to illustrate how these models can be an effective
            tool for leading change and achieving success in different environments.

            In the presentation I gave with my colleague Duaa, I explained the McKinsey Model for Change in a simplified
            manner. I explained that the model consists of several main steps, starting with identifying the need for
            change, then planning, implementation, and finally evaluation. I focused on the importance of effective
            communication during each stage, as it helps reduce resistance to change and increase employee acceptance of
            it. I also discussed the need to analyze the obstacles that may face the change process and the role of
            leadership in motivating and supporting teams. Finally, I emphasized the importance of evaluating the
            results and learning from them to improve future strategies.

                In this lecture, we learned how to create and develop a LinkedIn account in a way that enhances our
                chances of getting jobs. We started by creating the account and filling in basic data such as name, job
                title, and work experience. Then we moved on to how to improve the profile by adding a professional
                photo, and writing a summary that reflects our experiences and skills in an attractive way. We also
                focused on the importance of adding certificates and skills, and building a strong network of
                relationships by communicating with colleagues and professionals in the same field, which contributes to
                enhancing our visibility to employers.

                In this lecture, we learned how to create a professional resume and how to send it via LinkedIn and
                email to companies. We started by designing the resume, focusing on organizing sections such as personal
                information, education, work experience, and skills. Then, we explained how to upload the resume to
                LinkedIn and use it to apply for jobs through the platform. In addition, we discussed how to send the
                resume via email to companies, with an attached letter explaining interest in the job and highlighting
                relevant experiences. Finally, we reviewed the steps for applying for jobs through companies’ websites
                or recruitment platforms, and how to follow up on applications effectively.

                flexibility and the wide range of opportunities it offers. The discussion covered various categories of
                freelancing, from writing and design to programming and marketing. We were also introduced to several
                popular platforms that facilitate freelance work, such as Upwork, Fiverr, and Freelancer, which provide
                a gateway for professionals to connect with clients and pursue projects independently. This session

                In the lecture, freelance work was thoroughly explained, covering its various categories and how
                individuals can apply to start freelancing. Coach Balqees guided us through the process of exploring
                freelance platforms, including several popular ones in Jordan such as Khamsat and Mostaql . Each
                platform was discussed in detail, highlighting the types of services offered, how freelancers can
                register, and the steps to create a successful profile to attract clients. <br /><br />

                We were divided into teams to research and present on different platforms. I, along with another team,
                was chosen to focus on the Mostaql platform, which allows freelancers to connect with clients and offers
                a wide range of job categories, from programming to content creation. Our team will present more details
                about this platform later, explaining its unique features and how freelancers can utilize it to grow
                their careers. This structured approach helped us understand the nuances of each platform and the
                opportunities available for freelancers in the region.

                When we were divided into groups within the lecture with Coach Balqis, each group was assigned to
                explain a specific freelance platform. Our group was chosen to explain the Mostaqil platform, where I,
                Nourhan, and my teammates explained the platform in detail. We showed how to use the platform, starting
                with the process of creating a new account on it, through how to upload tasks and projects to clients
                and freelancers. We also explained the steps for searching for available opportunities and how to apply
                for them, in addition to how to submit job offers and successfully complete tasks. <br /><br />

                The Mostaqil platform is one of the most important Jordanian platforms for freelance work, as it
                provides an opportunity for freelancers to search for projects that suit their skills and communicate
                with clients. The platform allows users to browse job offers in various fields such as programming,
                design, translation, and writing, making it an ideal environment for developing expertise and generating
                additional income by working on various projects.
