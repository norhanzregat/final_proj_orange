                In my documentation of using Computer-Aided Design (CAD), I detail how I apply this software to create
                precise technical drawings and 3D models. By utilizing CAD tools, specifically <b>Fusion 360</b>, I can
                efficiently visualize and simulate designs before physical production. This approach ensures accuracy
                and allows for easy modifications, ultimately improving the design process. Through my work, I also
                explore how different materials and conditions can impact the performance of the design, ensuring that I
                meet both aesthetic and functional requirements.

                In this design, I’m working on a 3D model using <b>Fusion 360</b>. The image shows a part that I’ve
                created, which looks like a custom screw or fastener. I started by sketching the top profile in Sketch1,
                then used additional sketches (Sketch2 and Sketch3) to refine the design. The main tools which help me
                shape and adjust the model. For example, I used the <b>Extrude</b> function to extend the profile into a
                solid 3D object. The grid you see in the background helps me keep everything aligned and precise. My
                goal is to make sure that this part has the right dimensions and features for its intended use, and
                **Fusion 360** provides the tools I need to visualize and simulate the design before moving to
                production.

                In this design, I am working on a 3D model using Fusion 360. Here is a design of a transparent glass
                bottle. I started by drawing the initial outline of the bottle using Sketch1, where I drew its
                cross-section, and then used the <b>Revolve</b> tool to convert this outline into a 3D shape that is
                circular around a specific axis. The program displays design tools at the top such as Create and Modify,
                which help me modify and shape the model easily. These tools allow me to design the model with high
                accuracy while taking into account the details of the shape and the materials used.

                In this design, I’m working on a 3D model using Fusion 360 of a box with multiple compartments (an ice
                cube tray). The design started with Sketch1, where I drew the basic outline of the box shape. I then
                used tools like <b>Extrude</b> to transform this outline into a 3D object. The model features several
                small compartments arranged in even rows, making it suitable for uses like storage or growing seeds. The
                software allows me to easily adjust the dimensions and review the design from all angles to make sure
                the final shape fits my needs perfectly.

                “In this design, I created a 3D model using Autodesk Fusion 360. The model consists of a green cylinder
                connected to an orange arm. At the end of the arm is a component that looks like a wheel or pulley. When
                the wheel is turned, the cylinder inside the model moves. I used this design to simulate a certain
                mechanical movement, where I can see how the different parts interact with each other. This type of
                modeling helps me make sure that the design works correctly before moving on to the actual manufacturing
                stage.

                I created a 3D model of a cup using Fusion 360's Revolve tool. The design began with a basic sketch of
                the cup's profile on a 2D plane. Using the Revolve tool, I rotated this profile around a central axis to
                form the full 3D shape. This approach allowed me to precisely control the shape of the cup, ensuring it
                has smooth curves and an even surface. Fusion 360’s features also let me fine-tune dimensions and view
                the model from all angles, ensuring the final design met my specifications.

                I designed a 3D model of a diamond using the Polygon tool in Fusion 360. I started by drawing a 12-sided
                polygon. I then used transform tools like Extrude to transform this polygon into a 3D diamond-like
                shape. This method helped me to form the facets accurately and symmetrically. I was also able to adjust
                the dimensions and view the design from all angles to ensure the final shape was up to the
                specifications.

                I designed a 3D hairbrush using Fusion 360. I started by drawing the oval shape of the brush head using
                the Sketch tool, then converted it into a 3D model using the Extrude tool. Next, I drew the long handle
                of the brush attached to the head, and added it using the same tool. I used tools like Offset to create
                additional layers for the brush head to accurately define the dimensions. Finally, I used the Construct
                tool to adjust the position of the handle in relation to the brush head and ensure the design was
                balanced. These steps allowed me to control the dimensions of the brush and review it from all angles to
                ensure the final design was consistent with the requirements.

                I designed a 3D circular frame using Fusion 360. I started by drawing the basic outline of the frame as
                a circle, then used the Extrude tool to convert it into a 3D shape with an inner cavity. I then
                added two raised edges on the edges using the Offset tool to duplicate the layer and adjust the
                thickness of the edges. Finally, I adjusted the settings to make the inner part transparent, to
                highlight the cavity and highlight the design details. This frame can be used in industrial or
                engineering applications, with the dimensions easily adjustable to suit different needs.
