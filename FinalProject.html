            The final project I am presenting is a Smart Stethoscope, a groundbreaking healthcare device designed to
            measure vital signs such as blood oxygen levels, blood pressure, heart rate, and body temperature. This
            innovative stethoscope aims to integrate multiple sensors and modern technologies to provide a compact,
            user-friendly, and accurate tool for medical professionals and patients alike. By incorporating sensors like
            the MAX30100 for heart rate and oxygen measurement, the MLX90615 for body temperature, and an OLED display,
            this stethoscope will serve as a reliable, all-in-one solution for monitoring critical health data in
            real-time.<br /><br />

            In this documentation, I will delve into various aspects of the project, starting from the design phase of
            the stethoscope and moving through the 3D printing process to create its parts. The design of the sensors,
            their integration, and the process of programming them using Arduino will also be covered in detail. I will
            explain how each sensor is carefully selected, assembled, and programmed to ensure optimal performance and
            precision. Additionally, I will walk through the process of designing and printing the necessary components
            using 3D printing technology, which allows for custom, ergonomic designs tailored to the stethoscope's
            intended use.<br /><br />

            Beyond the technical aspects, I will also cover the creative side of the project, including the design of
            the logo and branding, to ensure the device has a professional and cohesive identity. This documentation
            will offer insights into the entire journey of developing the Smart Stethoscope—from conception and design
            to the final product—highlighting both the technical expertise and creative effort involved in bringing this
            innovative medical tool to life.

                As a doctor, the stethoscope is one of the most important and widely used tools. It’s a device doctors
                carry with them throughout their day, whether in the clinic or hospital. However, while the stethoscope
                is essential for listening to a heartbeat, it only measures one aspect of a patient’s health – heart
                rate. This limitation got me thinking: why should a doctor need multiple devices to measure other vital
                signs such as blood pressure, temperature, and oxygen levels? Why not combine all of these functions
                into one convenient tool that can display real-time data on a small screen, making it easier for doctors
                to quickly and accurately assess the health of their patients?<br /><br />

                The initial concept for this project was inspired by artificial intelligence, which led us to envision a
                smart stethoscope. With the help of AI, we began to realize the possibility of integrating multiple
                vital-sign monitoring features into a single device. This sparked a series of ideas and innovations that
                we started to explore. The smart stethoscope we conceived would not only listen to heartbeats, but also
                measure blood pressure, oxygen saturation, and body temperature, all in one device. By merging these
                features into one tool, doctors can save time and effort while providing more comprehensive care to
                their patients. This project was born from a simple desire to address a common issue and create a more
                efficient and effective tool for healthcare professionals.

            Here, we began to broaden the scope of our research, diving deeper into identifying the specific sensors
            required to implement this device, one component at a time. Our focus was on exploring each sensor's
            compatibility, functionality, and suitability for our smart stethoscope. We investigated various sensor
            types to measure vital signs accurately, including those for monitoring heart rate, blood pressure, oxygen
            saturation, and body temperature. This process involved understanding each sensor’s specifications, how they

            information on each part to ensure it met our functional and technical needs, paying special attention to
            details that would support accurate data collection. Additionally, we researched vendors within Jordan, such
            as Wasleh, to source the necessary parts and reviewed the pricing options for each sensor. This
            comprehensive approach allowed us to develop a clear plan for assembling a simplified prototype and to

            Research and planning began to select all the components needed for the project, where it was determined
            that the Arduino Nano was the most suitable in terms of small size and efficiency in performing the required
            tasks. In addition, a breadboard was chosen to facilitate the temporary installation of wires and components
            before moving on to the final connections, allowing for safe and flexible testing of the system. The
            appropriate wires were also identified for the various connections, so that they fit the components and
            ensure the stability of signals between devices. <br /><br />

            Regarding the sensors, the MAX30100 sensor was chosen to measure heart rate and blood oxygen levels, in
            addition to the MLX90614 sensor to accurately measure temperature. Other sensors that may be necessary for
            the project were also identified. After collecting all the available information and options, they were
            organized in an Excel file that includes accurate details for each component, such as the required quantity,
            prices, part number, and technical specifications for each item. <br /><br />

            After that, a purchase order was placed for all the required components from the Microelectronics website,
            which provides a wide range of high-quality electronic components. The expected arrival timeline was
            determined, to ensure that all parts are available on time, which ensures smooth and efficient work
            continuity.

            After placing an order for the necessary parts from Microelectronics, the required components were received
            on time. Once the parts arrived, we started opening the packages and organizing the components according to
            the pre-planned layout. All the parts were checked for integrity and number, and we made sure that each
            component matched the specifications listed in the Excel file. With the basic components such as the Arduino
            Nano, the Breadboard, the wires, and the various sensors in place, we started the initial assembly phase,
            where the parts were assembled on the Breadboard and prepared for initial testing. Work is now underway to

            such as the measurements of the sensors, electronics, and wires, in addition to the measurements of the
            Arduino Nano. Precision measuring tools were used to ensure that all dimensions matched the initial design.
            These measurements are an essential step in the design phase, as the necessary data was collected to
            determine how to effectively distribute the components on the mailboard, as well as to determine the
            appropriate distances and paths for wires and connections between the pieces. Through this process, all

            After identifying and connecting the required components, we began by taking precise measurements for each
            part based on their real-world dimensions. These measurements served as the foundation for designing each
            part in Fusion 360. Working in Fusion 360 requires great accuracy when defining measurements, as the program
            provides tools like "Dimensions" to set distances and angles precisely, as well as "Scale" to ensure the
            dimensions match real-world proportions. Taking accurate measurements involves using tools such as rulers or
            micrometers and considering slight tolerances that might occur when translating real-world measurements into
            3D models. Fusion 360 also offers "Inspect" tools to verify these measurements during the design process to
            ensure alignment and consistency. Once the design is complete, we convert it into a printable format, ready
            for 3D printing. At this stage, it’s essential to check that all parts will fit together correctly, ensuring
            the pieces will connect and align properly after printing. This step guarantees that the design is not only
            accurate but also functional in the physical assembly.

            Initial designs for the speakers were first developed, as they were not yet approved, and were intended to
            study how the parts would be arranged inside the speaker. Although these initial designs were an important
            step in understanding how the components would fit together, they were not the final design. These designs
            were later discarded because they would have taken up too much space during the printing process, and they
            were too large, which would have affected the efficiency of the printing. The parts were also not well
            arranged in the design, as they were all spread out in a large width, which made the assembly and
            coordination not ideal. After evaluating these designs, we moved towards another design that was more
            accurate and suitable for the project. I will now explain this final design that was approved, which is
            based on better organization of the components to ensure optimal performance when actually printing and
            assembling.

            The final design of the stethoscope has now been adopted vertically, with all components arranged within
            this model in a thoughtful and effective manner. The design is based on the principle of integrating the
            parts in a manner similar to a real stethoscope, ensuring that the stethoscope is of an appropriate size and
            easy to use. Through the vertical arrangement, it was ensured that all components, such as sensors, screen
            and charging, are integrated within the body in a way that ensures maintaining the small size of the
            stethoscope, making it easy for the doctor to carry and use while examining patients. The final design was
            also implemented using 3D modeling technology in Fusion 360, which allows us to accurately determine the
            dimensions and ensure that all the parts will fit perfectly together when assembled. After completing the 3D
            design, we will begin the printing process using the 3D printer, where the parts will be printed according
            to these precise measurements. Through this process, we expect to obtain highly accurate printed parts that
            can be easily assembled, ensuring that the stethoscope will be ready for practical use, while maintaining
            its small size and effectiveness in medical examination.

            The under layer was printed using an Ender 6 printer, where the design was prepared in advance in Fusion
            360. This layer is the foundation for building the 3D model, and is carefully printed to ensure stability
            and consistency for the rest of the layers. Before printing, the printer settings, such as nozzle
            temperature and print speed, were carefully adjusted to ensure that the first layer adheres well to the
            printing surface. As shown in the image, the first layer is formed with an even and consistent distribution
            of materials, allowing the final project to achieve the highest level of quality and solidity. This step is
            vital, as any error in the under layer could affect the stability and shape of the final model, which makes
            the printer setup and print monitoring essential to ensure the success of the project.

            After completing the printing of the Under Layer, the middle layer was printed using the Ender 2 printer.
            This layer is a complementary step as it builds on top of the bottom layer to enhance the structure and add
            basic details to the model. This layer was designed on the Fusion 360 program, where the thickness of the
            layers and their infill pattern were determined to suit the project requirements. During printing, good
            cohesion between the middle layer and the bottom layer was ensured to ensure rigidity and cohesion between
            the parts. As shown in the image, the middle layer shows more details and contributes to forming the overall
            structure of the model, taking into account the consistent distribution of materials. This layer is
            considered a pivotal part as it contributes to supporting the upper layers that will be added later, making
            it a basic point of contact between the base and the final details.

            The MAX30102 and MLX96014 sensors were soldered and prepared in the lab, where I carefully connected the
            components to ensure that they would work in harmony. We started by soldering the wires for each sensor,
            making sure that the wires were connected in the correct directions on the board. The MAX30102 sensor is
            used to measure heart rate and blood oxygen levels, while the MLX96014 sensor measures temperature. The
            soldering process was done using the precision tools available in the lab, taking care to ensure that there

            The project's sensors were programmed, and I prepared libraries for each sensor separately to ensure that
            they interact properly with other components. MAX30102 Library: This library is dedicated to controlling the
            MAX30102 sensor, which is used to measure heart rate and blood oxygen levels. The library reads data from
            the sensor and converts it into values that can be processed using the Arduino. This library was used to
            initialize the sensor and set the necessary parameters to obtain an accurate reading of heart rate and
            oxygen levels. MLX96014 Library: This library is responsible for dealing with the MLX96014 sensor, which
            measures temperature with high accuracy. The sensor was programmed to read data periodically and display the
            measured temperature on an OLED screen. The library provides easy interaction with the sensor and helps in
            reading sensory data and converting it into an understandable value. Each library was carefully configured,
            and the codes for each sensor were included in the main program to deal with each sensor individually
            smoothly and efficiently.
